    it is accepted but will be judged as strictly as human-only coding:
- Please avoid generating PRs, PRs comments and issue with a chatbot.
 Please avoid generating PRs, PR comments, and issues with a chatbot.
- do not submit code which you don't understand.
 Avoid submitting code you do not fully understand.
 Additionally, extensive refactoring is discouraged as it takes significant time for maintainers to review.
